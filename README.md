# Day12-of-100-Days-of-Code-Python
# Local Scope
* if a variable is declared inside a function then it is only accessible inside the function

# Global Scope
* if a variable is declared outside the function then it can be accessed anywere

# There is No Block Scope
* if a variable is decalred in a block other then a function then it is not a local scope

# Modifing Global Scope
* Modifing global scope inside a function is possible by typing 'global variable_name' then you can modify it in side the function but it is highly unrecommended

# Global Constants
* are the constants which you don't have to change once declared such variables in python are declared with uppercase letters
* PI=3.14
* URL="google.com"
# Guess the Number

* A text based game where the computer selects a number from 1 to 100 randomly and prompts the user to guess.

* Two levels of play are incorporated - easy and hard: hard = 5 attempts, easy = 10 attempts.

* After each guess the user will be advised whether the guess is too high or too low and how many attempts left.

* Global / constant variables are introduced in this lesson: they appear in UPPERCASE.
